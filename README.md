Hello, my name is Katherine Shun-Gilmour and I am finishing up my second year of Electrical Engineering. I am completing my EE 296 project in the Smart Campus Energy Lab under the direction of Dr. Anthony Kuh. We are working on a weather box project to help determine optimal places for photovoltaic panels around campus.
